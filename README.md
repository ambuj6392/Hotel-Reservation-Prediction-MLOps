# 📍 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a hotel reservation will be **canceled or honored** based on booking details.  
It is built using a complete **MLOps pipeline**, covering model training, tracking, versioning, containerization, CI/CD automation, and cloud deployment.

---

# 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used

- **Python 3.10**

- **Machine Learning:** LightGBM, Scikit-Learn

- **MLOps Tools:** MLflow, Docker, Jenkins, GitHub Actions

- **Backend:** Flask

- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, Artifact Registry)

- **Others:** Pandas, NumPy, YAML, Joblib

---

# 🏗️ Project Architecture

The following architecture represents the complete end-to-end MLOps workflow:

- **Data Ingestion** → **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**
- **Model Training (LightGBM)**
- **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**
- **Model Saving and Versioning**
- **Containerization with Docker**
- **CI/CD Automation with Jenkins**
- **Deployment on Google Cloud Run**

🐳 Docker Setup
Build Docker Image

docker build -t hotel-reservation-prediction .
Run Docker Container

docker run -p 8080:8080 hotel-reservation-prediction
⚙️ Jenkins Setup (CI/CD)
A Jenkinsfile is created for pipeline automation.

Jenkins is configured with Docker and GitHub to pull code, build images, and deploy.

☁️ Deployment on Google Cloud Run
Push Docker Image to Google Artifact Registry

Deploy the containerized application on Google Cloud Run

Auto-scaling and serverless execution
